The above problem was solved with both Minizinc and ASP, and tested over three sets of benchmark instances respectively composed of "easy", "medium" and "hard" instances.

## Benchmark results
Below you can see the mean and variances obtained by each category in both Clingo and Minizinc, with a timeout of 300 seconds.

## Further details
A complete description of the tools used to solve the problem with Clingo and Minizinc can be found in "./report.pdf". Note, however, that the report is written in italian.
